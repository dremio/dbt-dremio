**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

dbt is the T in ELT. Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.

## dbt-dremio preview version 1.1.0b ##

The `dbt-dremio` package contains all of the code enabling dbt to work with Dremio. For more information on using dbt with Dremio, consult [the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/dremio-profile).

The dbt-dremio package supports both Dremio Cloud and Dremio Software (versions 22.0 and later).

Installing the dbt-dremio package will install or update dbt-core to version 1.3.0.

> Prior to version 1.1.0b, dbt-dremio was created and maintained by [Fabrice Etanchaud](https://github.com/fabrice-etanchaud) on [their GitHub repo](https://github.com/fabrice-etanchaud/dbt-dremio). Code for using Dremio REST APIs was originally authored by [Ryan Murray](https://github.com/rymurr). Contributors in this repo are credited for laying the groundwork and maintaining the adapter till version 1.0.6.5. The dbt-dremio adapter is maintained and distributed by Dremio starting with version 1.1.0b.
